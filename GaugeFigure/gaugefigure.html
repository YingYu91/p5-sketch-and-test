        This experiment measures your perception of 3D shape. Move the mouse behind the image and adjust the figure so that it lies flat 
        on the surface. The rod should stick out perpendicularly (90 degree angle). Spend about 3 seconds (on average) per trial, 
        in the beginning it will take longer, at the end it will take less. Experiment should thus take about 3 minutes. </p>
